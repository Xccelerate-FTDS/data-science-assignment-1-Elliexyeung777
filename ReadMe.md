# Data Science Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tutorial assignment! This tutorial is designed to help you understand and apply the key concepts of EDA using Python. By the end of this assignment, you will be equipped with hands-on experience in loading, cleaning, visualizing data, and uncovering insights from a dataset. For assignment 2, you will need to do these activities on your own.

## Objectives

1. Learn to load and explore datasets.
2. Perform data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis.
4. Visualize data to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.
5. Draw actionable insights from the dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with data manipulation and visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The programming language we will use.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For internal data representation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## General EDA Structure

### Part 1: Data Loading and Preliminary Exploration

1. **Load the Dataset**: Use Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
   ```

2. **Understand the Dataset**: Use initial exploration commands to understand the structure of the dataset.
   ```python
   print(data.head())
   print(data.info())
   print(data.describe())
   ```

### Part 2: Data Cleaning

1. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values appropriately.
   ```python
   data.isnull().sum()
   data = data.dropna()  # Example: Dropping rows with missing values
   ```

2. **Manage Outliers**: Detect and manage outliers in the dataset.
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   sns.boxplot(data['column_name'])
   ```

### Part 3: Univariate Analysis

1. **Analyze Individual Columns**: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of each feature.
   ```python
   data['column_name'].hist()
   ```

### Part 4: Bivariate Analysis

1. **Analyze Relationships between Variables**: Perform bivariate analysis to discover relationships between variables.
   ```python
   sns.scatterplot(x='column1', y='column2', data=data)
   ```

### Part 5: Data Visualization

1. **Visualize Data**: Create visualizations to represent the data effectively.
   ```python
   sns.pairplot(data)
   ```

### Part 6: Drawing Insights

1. **Derive Insights**: Analyze the visualizations and statistical outputs to derive meaningful insights from the data.
   ```python
   # Comment on the insights derived from the analysis
   ```

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Notebook Submission**: Submit your Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) containing all the code and visualizations.
2. **Report**: Include a brief report summarizing your findings and insights from the EDA tutorial.
